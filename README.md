# Project: What-and-Where-are-the-World-s-Oldest-Businesses

_****
In this personal project, which based on Datacamp database, I would like to research through the dataset and figure out the answer of the main question: "What and Where are the World's Oldest Businesses?". By using SQL functions Ã n some techniques, I can find the list of name, quanity, locations for each question required.****_

**Key Learnings**

- Using aggregate functions such as MAX(), MIN(), COUNT()
- Filter techniques such as WHERE, GROUP BY and HAVING
- Sorting using ORDER BY
- Inner JOIN and LEFT JOIN


The database contains three tables: categories, countries, businesses
